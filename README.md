This is a website meant to be the main website for the two-piece band I Don't Know How But They Found Me after the release of theit latest album, Razzmatazz. The website takes a lot of inspiration from the colour scheme of the album and tries to stay loyal to the theme that the band has. The website would allow fans to gain more insight to the band in both pictorial and text form. It also features the store in the main page to encourage fans to visit the main store.

The website is aimed at advertising the band's new album, giving new fans an idea of the aesthetics of the band, and giving existing fans a dose of new videos and lore that contribute to the band's image.
 
## Design Process
This website is made for a band which started a few years ago and is still in the process of growing their discography and fanbase. I fist looked at their actual page (https://idkhow.com/ made in notepad). It is very focused on the lore of the band and newer fans might be confused (with the white figure that appears at the bottom). The website I made is aimed at making the website understandable for the masses and maybe make the band more appealing. It also advertises their merch a lot more to get fans' attention.

- As a new fan, I want to learn more about the band to understand their music more (about page is helpful)
- As an existing fan, I want to find more details on the band members and get more photos of them, I also want to be more involved with the band (about and gallery page, newsletter to get involved)
- As a complete outsider (e.g. news reporter, parent of fan), I want to find out what the band is like, so as to decide whether I want to keep listening / get an opinion on them (spotify and apple are embedded in the home page with the main single of the album for convenience)
- As someone looking for when they are touring, I want to find out where they are touring so I can buy a ticket. (tour page)

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
